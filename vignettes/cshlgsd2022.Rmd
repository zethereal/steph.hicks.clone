# Create a copy of this repository

You can create a new GitHub repository in your own GitHub account that is 
a copy of this repository for yourself to edit/write code and notes. 
Github calls this "creating a template repository." 
This is different than a fork because there will be no link between the original and your repository.
From there, you can clone the repository with the `git clone` command and run / edit the code in the repository.

Creating a repository with the template can be done in the following way: 

- Go to https://github.com/stephaniehicks/cshlgsd2022
- Click on the "Use this template" button at the top of the GitHub template repository

![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-36544/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.png)

From there, you can [follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). However do not optionally select "**Include all branches**" as you do not need this for your own projects.

# Software

I will make heavy use of R, so you should have R installed. You can obtain R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). There are versions available for Mac, Windows, and Unix/Linux. This software is **required** for this course.	

It is important that you have the latest version of R installed. I will be using **R version `r paste(version$major, version$minor, sep = ".")`**. You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console `R.version.string` and hitting the `return`/`enter` key. If you do not have the latest version of R installed, go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and download and install the latest version.

I will also make use of the RStudio interactive development environment (IDE). RStudio requires that R be installed, and so is an "add-on" to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the [RStudio web site](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

## Install packages

These materials use Bioconductor version 3.15.
This is the current 'release' version of Bioconductor, which can be installed following [these instructions](https://bioconductor.org/install).

For example, you can then install a subset of the packages necessary for these tutorials using the following:

```
library(BiocManager)
install(c("SingleCellExperiment", "TENxPBMCData", "scater", "scran",
  "scry", "mbkmeans"))
```

Please see the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/cshlgsd2022/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) for a full list of dependencies.
